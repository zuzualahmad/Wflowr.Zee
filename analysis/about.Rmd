## Project Overview

My project explores a 2024 pharmacological dataset featuring ligands that target **3,067 human receptors**, with **1,732** of these having meticulously curated quantitative ligand interactions. The dataset includes **12,590 ligands**, with **9,204** boasting curated quantitative target interactions.

It also encompasses **1,981 approved drugs**, **1,128** of which have well-documented quantitative interactions. Clinical summaries are provided for over **3,704 ligands**, among which **1,971** are approved drugs.

### Key Highlights
